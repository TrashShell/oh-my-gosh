# oh-my-gosh

Try to make a shell using simple programming language [__Nasal__](https://github.com/ValKmjolnir/Nasal-Interpreter).

If you feel hard to use this shell, that's right.

`bash`, `zsh`, `sh`, `oh-my-gosh`? TRASH!

## how to use

First you should get [__Nasal__](https://github.com/ValKmjolnir/Nasal-Interpreter) interpreter.

Then use this command to run:

> ./nasal -op -e main.nas

## what is nasal-lang

It is a programming language designed by [Andy Ross](https://github.com/andyross). Mainly used in a famous flight simulator [FlightGear](https://wiki.flightgear.org/Main_Page). I re-write a new interpreter for this language and use it to run this shell.
